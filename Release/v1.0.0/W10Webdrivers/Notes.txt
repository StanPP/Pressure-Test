Pressure Test Selenium Webdriver task
-------------------------------------

General information
-------------------

The PressureTest.zip file includes two directories

\BrandViewTest - This is an export of the Eclipse Java project.  Source code for this excercise is in the \test directory.
\W10Webdrivers - An executable .jar for this excercise.

The code has been built and tested on Windows 10 Home edition.

It is written in Java and tested using JUnit4.

The code is currently specifically written for just the Mozilla Firefox browser.


Setup and operation
-------------------

To run the code requires Java runtime v1.8.0_121 or above (Currently the latest available from Oracle).

I have exported the code to a runnable .jar and for simplicity just copy the supplied W10Webdrivers folder to the root of C: and run from there.
The code expects to find the Firefox Gecko driver in c:\W10Webdrivers.

Open a command prompt and to execute type the following:

C:\W10Webdrivers> java -jar ptFirefox.jar

or run the batch file provided.

Improvements, observations & future investigations
--------------------------------------------------

Parameterise the input to support other browsers.  Currently Firefox only, have tried it with Edge and found page load is slower sometimes causing a problem.

Put the table extraction code into a common method, rather than repeat it as I've done.

Consider using the URL for Reading (http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/2639577) rather than executing a search each time.

After 21:00 in the evening, this value disappears from the page for the current day, so I've added flexibility to allow this to be changed.  This could be an issue if this test were being run on an automated system late in the evening.

Have tried to avoid just putting in sleep timers, whilst pages load, but still have seen some issues where the objects are available and can be used, but the page is still catching up and not ready.
